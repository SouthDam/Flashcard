Unlike first-order logic, which has only one standard semantics, there are two different semantics that are commonly used for second-order logic: standard semantics and Henkin semantics. In each of these semantics, the interpretations of the first-order quantifiers and the logical connectives are the same as in first-order logic. Only the ranges of quantifiers over second-order variables differ in the two types of semantics (Väänänen 2001).', 'In standard semantics, also called full semantics, the quantifiers range over all sets or functions of the appropriate sort. Thus once the domain of the first-order variables is established, the meaning of the remaining quantifiers is fixed. It is these semantics that give second-order logic its expressive power, and they will be assumed for the remainder of this article.', \"In Henkin semantics, each sort of second-order variable has a particular domain of its own to range over, which may be a proper subset of all sets or functions of that sort. Leon Henkin (1950) defined these semantics and proved that Gödel's completeness theorem and compactness theorem, which hold for first-order logic, carry over to second-order logic with Henkin semantics. This is because Henkin semantics are almost identical to many-sorted first-order semantics, where additional sorts of variables are added to simulate the new variables of second-order logic. Second-order logic with Henkin semantics is not more expressive than first-order logic. Henkin semantics are commonly used in the study of second-order arithmetic.\", 'Jouko Väänänen (2001) argued that the choice between Henkin models and full models for second-order logic is analogous to the choice between ZFC and V as a basis for set theory: \"As with second-order logic, we cannot really choose whether we axiomatize mathematics using V or ZFC. The result is the same in both cases, as ZFC is the best attempt so far to use V as an axiomatization of mathematics.\"'], '== Expressive power ==': ['Second-order logic is more expressive than first-order logic. For example, if the domain is the set of all real numbers, one can assert in first-order logic the existence of an additive inverse of each real number by writing ∀x ∃y (x + y = 0) but one needs second-order logic to assert the least-upper-bound property for sets of real numbers, which states that every bounded, nonempty set of real numbers has a supremum. If the domain is the set of all real numbers, the following second-order sentence (split over two lines) expresses the least upper bound property:', '(∀ A) ([(∃ w) (w ∈ A) ∧ (∃ z)(∀ u)(u ∈ A → u ≤ z)]', '→ (∃ x)(∀ y)[(∀ w)(w ∈ A → w ≤ x)] ∧ [(∀ u)(u ∈ A → u ≤ y)] → x ≤ y))This formula is a direct formalization of \"every nonempty, bounded set A has a least upper bound.\" It can be shown that any ordered field that satisfies this property is isomorphic to the real number field. On the other hand, the set of first-order sentences valid in the reals has arbitrarily large models due to the compactness theorem. Thus the least-upper-bound property cannot be expressed by any set of sentences in first-order logic.

Several deductive systems can be used for second-order logic, although none can be complete for the standard semantics (see below). Each of these systems is sound, which means any sentence they can be used to prove is logically valid in the appropriate semantics.', 'The weakest deductive system that can be used consists of a standard deductive system for first-order logic (such as natural deduction) augmented with substitution rules for second-order terms. This deductive system is commonly used in the study of second-order arithmetic.', 'The deductive systems considered by Shapiro (1991) and Henkin (1950) add to the augmented first-order deductive scheme both comprehension axioms and choice axioms. These axioms are sound for standard second-order semantics. They are sound for Henkin semantics restricted to Henkin models satisfying the comprehension and choice axioms.'], '== Non-reducibility to first-order logic ==': ['One might attempt to reduce the second-order theory of the real numbers, with full second-order semantics, to the first-order theory in the following way. First expand the domain from the set of all real numbers to a two-sorted domain, with the second sort containing all sets of real numbers. Add a new binary predicate to the language: the membership relation. Then sentences that were second-order become first-order, with the formerly second-order quantifiers ranging over the second sort instead. This reduction can be attempted in a one-sorted theory by adding unary predicates that tell whether an element is a number or a set, and taking the domain to be the union of the set of real numbers and the power set of the real numbers.', 'But notice that the domain was asserted to include all sets of real numbers. That requirement cannot be reduced to a first-order sentence, as the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem shows. That theorem implies that there is some countably infinite subset of the real numbers, whose members we will call internal numbers, and some countably infinite collection of sets of internal numbers, whose members we will call \"internal sets\", such that the domain consisting of internal numbers and internal sets satisfies exactly the same first-order sentences as are satisfied by the domain of real numbers and sets of real numbers. In particular, it satisfies a sort of least-upper-bound axiom that says, in effect:', \"Every nonempty internal set that has an internal upper bound has a least internal upper bound.Countability of the set of all internal numbers (in conjunction with the fact that those form a densely ordered set) implies that that set does not satisfy the full least-upper-bound axiom. Countability of the set of all internal sets implies that it is not the set of all subsets of the set of all internal numbers (since Cantor's theorem implies that the set of all subsets of a countably infinite set is an uncountably infinite set). This construction is closely related to Skolem's paradox.\", 'Thus the first-order theory of real numbers and sets of real numbers has many models, some of which are countable. The second-order theory of the real numbers has only one model, however.', 'This follows from the classical theorem that there is only one Archimedean complete ordered field, along with the fact that all the axioms of an Archimedean complete ordered field are expressible in second-order logic. This shows that the second-order theory of the real numbers cannot be reduced to a first-order theory, in the sense that the second-order theory of the real numbers has only one model but the corresponding first-order theory has many models.', 'There are more extreme examples showing that second-order logic with standard semantics is more expressive than first-order logic. There is a finite second-order theory whose only model is the real numbers if the continuum hypothesis holds and which has no model if the continuum hypothesis does not hold (cf. Shapiro 2000, p. 105). This theory consists of a finite theory characterizing the real numbers as a complete Archimedean ordered field plus an axiom saying that the domain is of the first uncountable cardinality. This example illustrates that the question of whether a sentence in second-order logic is consistent is extremely subtle.', 'Additional limitations of second order logic are described in the next section.'], '== Metalogical results ==': [\"It is a corollary of Gödel's incompleteness theorem that there is no deductive system (that is, no notion of provability) for second-order formulas that simultaneously satisfies these three desired attributes:\", '(Soundness) Every provable second-order sentence is universally valid, i.e., true in all domains under standard semantics.', '(Completeness) Every universally valid second-order formula, under standard semantics, is provable.', '(Effectiveness) There is a proof-checking algorithm that can correctly decide whether a given sequence of symbols is a proof or not.This corollary is sometimes expressed by saying that second-order logic does not admit a complete proof theory. In this respect second-order logic with standard semantics differs from first-order logic; Quine (1970, pp. 90–91) pointed to the lack of a complete proof system as a reason for thinking of second-order logic as not logic, properly speaking.', 'As mentioned above, Henkin proved that the standard deductive system for first-order logic is sound, complete, and effective for second-order logic with Henkin semantics, and the deductive system with comprehension and choice principles is sound, complete, and effective for Henkin semantics using only models that satisfy these principles.', 'The compactness theorem and the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem do not hold for full models of second-order logic. They do hold however for Henkin models. (Väänänen 2001)'], '== History and disputed value ==': [\"Predicate logic was introduced to the mathematical community by C. S. Peirce, who coined the term second-order logic and whose notation is most similar to the modern form (Putnam 1982). However, today most students of logic are more familiar with the works of Frege, who published his work several years prior to Peirce but whose works remained less known until Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead made them famous.  Frege used different variables to distinguish quantification over objects from quantification over properties and sets; but he did not see himself as doing two different kinds of logic.  After the discovery of Russell's paradox it was realized that something was wrong with his system.  Eventually logicians found that restricting Frege's logic in various ways—to what is now called first-order logic—eliminated this problem: sets and properties cannot be quantified over in first-order-logic alone.  The now-standard hierarchy of orders of logics dates from this time.\", 'It was found that set theory could be formulated as an axiomatized system within the apparatus of first-order logic (at the cost of several kinds of completeness, but nothing so bad as Russell\\'s paradox), and this was done (see Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory), as sets are vital for mathematics.  Arithmetic, mereology, and a variety of other powerful logical theories could be formulated axiomatically without appeal to any more logical apparatus than first-order quantification, and this, along with Gödel and Skolem\\'s adherence to first-order logic, led to a general decline in work in second (or any higher) order logic.This rejection was actively advanced by some logicians, most notably W. V. Quine.  Quine advanced the view that in predicate-language sentences like Fx the \"x\" is to be thought of as a variable or name denoting an object and hence can be quantified over, as in \"For all things, it is the case that . . .\" but the \"F\" is to be thought of as an abbreviation for an incomplete sentence, not the name of an object (not even of an abstract object like a property).  For example, it might mean \" . . . is a dog.\"  But it makes no sense to think we can quantify over something like this. (Such a position is quite consistent with Frege\\'s own arguments on the concept-object distinction). So to use a predicate as a variable is to have it occupy the place of a name which only individual variables should occupy. This reasoning has been rejected by George Boolos.In recent years second-order logic has made something of a recovery, buoyed by Boolos\\' interpretation of second-order quantification as plural quantification over the same domain of objects as first-order quantification (Boolos 1984). Boolos furthermore points to the claimed nonfirstorderizability of sentences such as \"Some critics admire only each other\" and \"Some of Fianchetto\\'s men went into the warehouse unaccompanied by anyone else\", which he argues can only be expressed by the full force of second-order quantification.  However, generalized quantification and partially ordered, or branching, quantification may suffice to express a certain class of purportedly nonfirstorderizable sentences as well and it does not appeal to second-order quantification.'], '== Relation to computational complexity ==': ['The expressive power of various forms of second-order logic on finite structures is intimately tied to computational complexity theory. The field of descriptive complexity studies which computational complexity classes can be characterized by the power of the logic needed to express languages (sets of finite strings) in  them. A string w = w1···wn in a finite alphabet A can be represented by a finite structure with domain D = {1,...,n}, unary predicates Pa for each a ∈ A, satisfied by those indices i such that wi = a, and additional predicates which serve to uniquely identify which index is which (typically, one takes the graph of the successor function on D or the order relation <, possibly with other arithmetic predicates). Conversely, the table of any finite structure can be encoded by a finite string.', 'This identification leads to the following characterizations of variants of second-order logic over finite structures:', \"REG (the set of regular languages) is definable by monadic, second-order formulas (Büchi's theorem, 1960)\", \"NP is the set of languages definable by existential, second-order formulas (Fagin's theorem, 1974).\", 'co-NP is the set of languages definable by universal, second-order formulas.', 'PH is the set of languages definable by second-order formulas.', 'PSPACE is the set of languages definable by second-order formulas with an added transitive closure operator.', 'EXPTIME is the set of languages definable by second-order formulas with an added least fixed point operator.Relationships among these classes directly impact the relative expressiveness of the logics over finite structures; for example, if PH = PSPACE, then adding a transitive closure operator to second-order logic would not make it any more expressive over finite structures.']}\n"

      "According to Strabo's Geographica, before the expansion of the Roman Republic, the name was used by Greeks to indicate the land between the strait of Messina and the line connecting the gulf of Salerno and gulf of Taranto.

The northern area of Cisalpine Gaul was occupied by Rome in the 220s BC and became considered geographically and de facto part of Italy.\n",
      "Thousands of Paleolithic-era artifacts have been recovered from Monte Poggiolo and dated to around 850,000 years before the present. They are the oldest evidence of first hominins habitation in the peninsula. The ancient peoples of pre-Roman Italy were Indo-European peoples. The main historic peoples of possible non-Indo-European heritage include the Etruscans of central and northern Italy. The prehistoric Sardinians gave birth to the Nuragic civilisation. Rome was ruled for a period of 244 years by a monarchical system. Initially with sovereigns of Latin and Sabine origin, later by Etruscan kings. In 509 BC, the Romans expelled the last king from their city, favouring a government of the Senate and the People. The Roman Empire was among the most powerful economic, cultural, political and military forces in the world of its time. At its height under Trajan, it covered 5 million square kilometres. The Roman legacy has deeply influenced the Western civilisation. The Western Empire, under the pressure of the barbarian invasions, eventually dissolved in 476 AD when its last emperor, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed. The Eastern half of the Empire survived for another thousand years. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Italy fell under the power of Odoacer's kingdom. The Lombard kingdom was subsequently absorbed into the Frankish Empire by Charlemagne in the late 8th century. The Franks also helped the formation of the Papal States in central Italy. In 1176 a league of city-states, the Lombard League, defeated the German emperor Frederick Barbarossa at the Battle of Legnano. Given the power vacuum caused by extreme territorial fragmentation and the struggle between the Empire and the Holy See, local communities sought autonomous ways to maintain law and order. The four best known maritime republics were Venice, Genoa, Pisa and Amalfi. The others were Ancona, Gaeta, Noli, and Ragusa. Venice maintained enormous tracts of land in Greece, Cyprus, Istria and Dalmatia. Venice and Genoa were Europe's main gateway to trade with the East, and a producer of fine glass. Florence was a capital of silk, wool, banks and jewellery. The wealth such business brought to Italy meant that large public and private artistic projects could be commissioned. Italy was the birthplace and heart of the Renaissance during the 1400s and 1500s. Renaissance exercised a dominant influence on subsequent European painting and sculpture for centuries afterwards. Artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Brunelleschi, Botticelli, Michelangelo, Raphael, Giotto, Donatello, and Titian. Following the western schism in favor of Rome at the Council of Constance (1415–1417), the new Pope Martin V returned to the Papal States. The Medici Bank was made the official credit institution of the Papacy. The Popes' status as elective monarchs turned the conclaves and consistories of the Renaissance into political battles between the courts of Italy for primacy in the peninsula. The fall of Constantinople led to the migration of Greek scholars and texts to Italy. Humanist rulers such as Federico da Montefeltro and Pope Pius II worked to establish ideal cities. Pico della Mirandola wrote the Oration on the Dignity of Man, considered the manifesto of Renaissance Humanism. Italian explorers and navigators from the dominant maritime republics offered their services to monarchs of Atlantic countries. Christopher Columbus is credited with discovering the New World and the opening of the Americas for conquest and settlement by Europeans. Key events of the period include: the Council of Trent (1545–1563), the excommunication of Elizabeth I (1570) and the Battle of Lepanto (1571) The Papacy remained independent and launched the Counter-reformation. The Italian economy declined during the 1600s and 1700s, as the peninsula was excluded from the rising Atlantic slave trade. During the Coalition Wars, northern-central Italy was reorganised by Napoleon in a number of Sister Republics of France and later as a Kingdom of Italy in personal union with the French Empire. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the political and social Italian unification movement, or Risorgimento, emerged. A prominent radical figure was the patriotic journalist Giuseppe Mazzini, member of the secret revolutionary society Carbonari. The most famous member of Young Italy was the revolutionary and general Giuseppe Garibaldi, renowned for his loyal followers. The Northern Italy monarchy of the House of Savoy in the Kingdom of Sardinia also had ambitions of establishing a united Italian state. Garibaldi led the drive for unification in Naples and Sicily. House of Savoy troops occupied the central territories of the Italian peninsula, except Rome and part of Papal States. Garibaldi sacrificed republican hopes for the sake of Italian unity under a monarchy. Victor Emmanuel II became the first king of a united Italy. In 1866, Victor Emmanuel II allied with Prussia during the Austro-Prussian War. In 1870, as France abandoned its garrisons in Rome, the Italians rushed to fill the power gap. Italian unification was completed and shortly afterward Italy's capital was moved to Rome. The new Kingdom of Italy obtained Great Power status. As Northern Italy quickly industrialised, the South and rural areas of the North remained underdeveloped. The Italian Socialist Party constantly increased in strength, challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment. Italy developed into a colonial power by forcing under its rule Eritrea and Somalia in East Africa, Tripolitania and Cyrenaica in North Africa. From 2 November 1899 to 7 September 1901, Italy also participated as part of the Eight-Nation Alliance forces during the Boxer Rebellion in China. The pre-war period dominated by Giovanni Giolitti, Prime Minister five times between 1892 and 1921, was characterized by the economic, industrial and political-cultural modernization of Italian society. Italy joined the Allies into World War I with a promise of substantial territorial gains. The war was initially inconclusive, as the Italian army got stuck in a long attrition war in the Alps. Eventually, in October 1918, the Italians launched a massive offensive, culminating in the victory of Vittorio Veneto. During the war, more than 650,000 Italian soldiers and as many civilians died and the kingdom went to the brink of bankruptcy. Italy gained a permanent seat in the League of Nations's executive council and obtained most of the promised territories. The socialist agitations that followed the devastation of the Great War led to counter-revolution and repression throughout Italy. The liberal establishment, fearing a Soviet-style revolution, started to endorse the small National Fascist Party, led by Benito Mussolini. In October 1922 the Blackshirts attempted a coup  named the \"March on Rome\" which failed. In 1935, Mussolini invaded Ethiopia and founded the Italian East Africa. In 1939, Italy annexed Albania, a de facto protectorate for decades. Italy entered World War II on 10 June 1940. The Italians were defeated in East Africa, Soviet Union and North Africa. During the interwar period, the fascist Italian government undertook a campaign of Italianisation in the areas it annexed. During World War II, Italian war crimes included extrajudicial killings and ethnic cleansing by deportation of about 25,000 people. In Italy and Yugoslavia, unlike in Germany, few war crimes were prosecuted. Yugoslav Partisans perpetrated their own crimes during and after the war, including the foibe killings. About 250,000 Italians and anti-communist Slavs fled to Italy in the Istrian exodus. An Allied invasion of Sicily began in July 1943, leading to the collapse of the Fascist regime and the fall of Mussolini on 25 July. Mussolini was deposed and arrested by order of King Victor Emmanuel III in co-operation with the majority of the members of the Grand Council of Fascism. Italy signed the Armistice of Cassibile, ending its war with the Allies. In the north, the Germans set up the Italian Social Republic (RSI), a Nazi puppet state with Mussolini installed as leader. Some Italian troops in the south were organized into the Italian Co-belligerent Army, which fought alongside the Allies for the rest of the war. Other Italian troops, loyal to Mussolini and his RSI, continued to fight alongside the Germans in the National Republican Army. In late April 1945, with total defeat looming, Mussolini attempted to escape north, but was captured and summarily executed near Lake Como. His body was then taken to Milan, where it was hung upside down at a service station for public viewing and to provide confirmation of his demise. Italy became a republic after a referendum held on 2 June 1946. This was also the first time that Italian women were entitled to vote. Victor Emmanuel III's son, Umberto II, was forced to abdicate and exiled. Fears of a possible Communist takeover (especially in the United States) proved crucial for the first universal suffrage electoral outcome on 18 April 1948. In 1949 Italy became a member of NATO. In 1957, Italy was a founding member of the European Economic Community (EEC) From the late 1960s until the early 1980s, Italy experienced a period of economic crisis and social conflicts. The Years of Lead culminated in the assassination of Christian Democrat leader Aldo Moro in 1978 and the Bologna railway station massacre in 1980. In the 1980s, for the first time since 1945, two governments were led by non-Christian-Democrat premiers. During Bettino Craxi's government, the economy recovered and Italy became the world's fifth largest industrial nation. However, as a result of his spending policies, the Italian national debt skyrocketed during the Craxi era, soon passing 100% of the country's GDP. In 1992, two major dynamite attacks killed the judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino. One year later, tourist spots were attacked, such as the Via dei Georgofili in Florence, Via Palestro in Milan and the Piazza San Giovanni in Laterano. The Catholic Church openly condemned the Mafia, and two churches were bombed and an anti-Mafia priest shot dead in Rome. Berlusconi resigned in 2011, and his conservative government was replaced by the technocratic cabinet of Mario Monti. Following the 2013 general election, the Vice-Secretary of the Democratic Party Enrico Letta formed a new government at the head of a right-left Grand coalition. In 2014, challenged by the new Secretary of the PD Matteo Renzi, Letta resigned. The new government started important constitutional reforms such as the abolition of the Senate and a new electoral law. In the European migrant crisis of the 2010s, Italy was the entry point and leading destination for most asylum seekers entering the EU. From 2013 to 2018, the country took in over 700,000 migrants and refugees, mainly from sub-Saharan Africa. The 2018 general election was characterized by a strong showing of the Five Star Movement and the League.\n"

      "Italy is located in Southern Europe, between latitudes 35° and 47° N, and longitudes 6° and 19° E. To the north, Italy borders France, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia. The sovereign states of San Marino and the Vatican City are enclaves within Italy. Campione d'Italia is an Italian exclave in Switzerland. Italy's total area is 301,230 square kilometres (116,306 sq mi), of which 294,020 km2 (113,522 sq mi) is land. The Apennine Mountains form the peninsula's backbone, and the Alps form most of its northern boundary. The Po Valley is the largest plain in Italy, with 46,000 km2 (18,000 sq mi) It represents over 70% of the total plain area in the country. Most of the small islands and archipelagos in the south are volcanic islands. There are also active volcanoes: Mount Etna in Sicily (the largest active volcano in Europe), Vulcano, Stromboli, and Vesuvius. There are also volcanoes on mainland Europe. The five largest lakes in Italy are Garda, Maggiore, Como, Trasimeno and Bolsena. Garda is the largest lake in Italy, with a surface of367.94 km2 (142 sq mi) Some of Italy's territory extends beyond the Alpine basin and some islands are located outside the Eurasian continental shelf. These territories are the comuni of Livigno, Sexten, Innichen, Toblach (in part), Chiusaforte, Tarvisio, Graun im Vinschgau. Most of the rivers of Italy drain either into the Adriatic Sea, such as the Po, Piave, Adige, Brenta, Tagliamento, and Reno, or into the Tyrrhenian. In the north of the country are a number of subalpine moraine-dammed lakes, the largest of which is Garda. There are 14 volcanoes in Italy, four of which are active. Etna, Stromboli, Vulcano and Vesuvius are most famous for their eruptions. Several islands and hills have been created by volcanic activity. Italy was the first country to exploit geothermal energy to produce electricity. The high geothermal gradient that forms part of the peninsula makes potentially exploitable also other provinces. Research carried out in the 1960s and 1970s identifies potential geothermal fields in Lazio and Tuscany. Italy ranks 84th in the world for ecological sustainability. In the last decade, Italy has become one of the world's leading producers of renewable energy. Renewable energies now make up about 12% of the total primary and final energy consumption. Air pollution remains a severe problem, especially in the industrialised north. Italy reached the tenth highest level worldwide of industrial carbon dioxide emissions in the 1990s. Italy is the twelfth largest carbon dioxide producer. <s>Smog is becoming an increasingly rarer phenomenon and levels of sulphur dioxide are decreasing. Smog levels have decreased dramatically since the 1970s and 1980s. Traffic and congestion continue to cause severe environmental and health issues. Many watercourses and coastal stretches have also been contaminated by industrial and agricultural activity. Waste from industrial activity is not always disposed of by legal means and has led to permanent health effects. The country has also operated several nuclear reactors between 1963 and 1990. Italy has the highest level of faunal biodiversity in Europe, with over 57,000 species recorded. The Italian peninsula is in the centre of the Mediterranean Sea, forming a corridor between central Europe and North Africa. Italy's varied geological structure contributes to its high climate and habitat diversity. Italian fauna includes 4,777 endemic animal species. There are 516 bird species and 56,213 invertebrate species. Italian wolf, Marsican brown bear, Pyrenean chamois, Alpine ibex, crested porcupine, Mediterranean monk seal, Alpine marmot. As of 2005, 6,759 species are recorded in the Data bank of Italian vascular flora. Italy is a signatory to the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats and the Habitats Directive. The climate of Italy is highly diverse. In most of the inland northern and central regions, the climate ranges from humid subtropical to humid continental and oceanic. The climate of the Po valley geographical region is mostly continental, with harsh winters and hot summers. Average summer temperatures in Sicily range from 20 °C to over 25 °C. Winters can vary widely across the country with lingering cold, foggy and snowy periods in the north and milder, sunnier conditions in the south.\n",
      "The President of Italy (Presidente della Repubblica), currently Sergio Mattarella since 2015, is Italy's head of state. The President is elected for a single seven years mandate by the Parliament of Italy and some regional voters in joint session. Italy has been a unitary parliamentary republic since 2 June 1946. Italy has a parliamentary government based on a mixed proportional and majoritarian voting system. The parliament is perfectly bicameral: the two houses, the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic, have the same powers. The Prime Minister, officially President of the Council of Ministers, is Italy's head of government. The prime minister is the President of the Council of Ministers. The office is similar to those in most other parliamentary systems. The leader of the Italian government is not authorised to request the dissolution of the Parliament of Italy. The overall political responsibility for intelligence is vested in the President of the Council of Ministers. By virtue of that, the Prime Minister has exclusive power to: co-ordinate intelligence policies, determining the financial resources and strengthening national cyber security. During the 2018 general election these three parties won 614 out of 630 seats available in the Chamber of Deputies and 309 out of 315 in the Senate. Berlusconi's Forza Italia formed a centre-right coalition with Matteo Salvini's Northern League and Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy. The Italian judicial system is based on Roman law modified by the Napoleonic code and later statutes. The Supreme Court of Cassation is the highest court in Italy for both criminal and civil appeal cases. The Constitutional Court of Italy (Corte Costituzionale) rules on the conformity of laws with the constitution. The Italian law enforcement system is complex, with multiple police forces. The national policing agencies are the Polizia di Stato (State Police), the Arma dei Carabinieri, the Guardia di Finanza (Financial Guard), and the Polizeia Penitenziaria (Prison Police) Italy is a founding member of the European Economic Community (EEC), now the European Union (EU), and of NATO. Italy was admitted to the United Nations in 1955. Its recent or upcoming turns in the rotating presidency of international organisations include the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in 2018. As of 2013, Italy was deploying 5,296 troops abroad, engaged in 33 UN and NATO missions in 25 countries of the world. Italy deployed troops in support of UN peacekeeping missions in Somalia, Mozambique, and East Timor. Italy supported international efforts to reconstruct and stabilise Iraq, but it had withdrawn its military contingent of some 3,200 troops by 2006. Italy maintained only humanitarian operators and other civilian personnel in Iraq. In August 2006 Italy deployed about 2,450 troops in Lebanon for the United Nations' peacekeeping mission UNIFIL. Italy is one of the largest financiers of the Palestinian National Authority, contributing €60 million in 2013 alone. The Italian Army, Navy, Air Force and Carabinieri collectively form the Italian Armed Forces. Total Italian military spending in 2010 ranked tenth in the world, standing at $35.8 billion, equal to 1.7% of national GDP. Since 2005, military service is voluntary. The Italian Navy in 2008 had 35,200 active personnel with 85 commissioned ships and 123 aircraft. In modern times the Italian Navy, being a member of the EU and NATO, has taken part in many coalition peacekeeping operations. The Italian Air Force in 2008 had a strength of 43,882 and operated 585 aircraft, including 219 combat jets and 114 helicopters. A transport capability is guaranteed by a fleet of 27 C-130Js and C-27J Spartan. The Carabinieri are the gendarmerie and military police of Italy. They are an autonomous corps of the military, but report to the Ministry of Internal Affairs when maintaining public order and security. Italy is constituted by 20 regions (regioni), 107 provinces (province) or metropolitan cities (città metropolitane), and 7,960 municipalities (comuni) Five regions have a special autonomous status that enables them to enact legislation on additional matters.\n"

      "Italy is a founding member of the G7, the Eurozone and the OECD. It is a highly developed country, with the world's 8th highest quality of life. The country is well known for its creative and innovative business. Italy is the world's sixth largest manufacturing country. It is characterised by a smaller number of global multinational corporations than other economies of comparable size. Its closest trade ties are with the other countries of the European Union, with whom it conducts 59% of its total trade. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles or FCA is currently the world's seventh-largest auto maker. The country boasts a wide range of acclaimed products, from very compact city cars to luxury supercars such as Maserati, Lamborghini and Ferrari. Italy has been hit hard by the Financial crisis of 2007–08, that exacerbated the country's structural problems. A gaping North–South divide is a major factor of socio-economic weakness. The richest province, Alto Adige-South Tyrol, earns 152% of the national GDP per capita. According to the last national agricultural census, there were 1.6 million farms in 2010. The vast majority (99%) are family-operated and small, averaging only 8 hectares in size. The most famous Italian wines are probably the Tuscan Chianti and the Piedmontese Barolo. Quality goods in which Italy specialises are often protected under the quality assurance labels DOC/DOP. This geographical indication certificate is considered important in order to avoid confusion with low-quality mass-produced ersatz products. In 2002 there were 668,721 km (415,524 mi) of serviceable roads in Italy. In 2005, about 34,667,000 passenger cars and 4,015,000 goods vehicles circulated on the national road network. The national railway network, state-owned and operated by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana, in 2008 totalled 16,529 km (10,271 mi) Italy is one of the countries with the most vehicles per capita, with 690 per 1000 people in 2010. The national inland waterways network comprised 2,400 km (1,491 mi) of navigable rivers and channels for various types of commercial traffic in 2012. Italy is the fifth in Europe by number of passengers by air transport, with about 148 million passengers or about 10% of the European total in 2011. In 2012 there were 130 airports in Italy, including the two hubs of Malpensa International in Milan and Leonardo da Vinci International in Rome. Moderate natural gas reserves, mainly in the Po Valley and offshore Adriatic Sea, have been discovered in recent years. Italy is one of the world's leading producers of pumice, pozzolana, and feldspar. Italy has become one of the world's largest producers of renewable energy. Wind power, hydroelectricity, and geothermal power are also important sources of electricity in the country. Renewable sources account for the 27.5% of all electricity produced in Italy. During the Renaissance Italian polymaths such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Leon Battista Alberti made important contributions to a variety of fields. Galileo Galilei (1564–1642), a physicist, mathematician and astronomer, played a major role in the Scientific Revolution. Other astronomers suchs as Giovanni Domenico Cassini (1625–1712) and Giovanni Schiaparelli (1835–1910) made many important discoveries about the Solar System. In mathematics, Joseph Louis Lagrange (born Giuseppe Lodovico Lagrangia, 1736–1813) was active before leaving Italy. In chemistry, Giulio Natta received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1963 for his work on high polymers. Italy is the fifth most visited country in the world, with a total of 52.3 million international arrivals in 2016. The total contribution of travel & tourism to GDP (including wider effects from investment, the supply chain and induced income impacts) was EUR162.7bn in 2014.\n",
      "At the beginning of 2020, Italy had 60,317,116 inhabitants. The resulting population density, at 202 inhabitants per square kilometre (520/sq mi), is higher than that of most Western European countries. The Po Valley accounts for almost a half of the national population. The population of Italy almost doubled during the 20th century. High fertility and birth rates persisted until the 1970s, after which they started to decline. By 2010, one in five Italians was over 65 years old, and the country currently has the fifth oldest population in the world. In 2016, Italy had about 5.05 million foreign residents, making up 8.3% of the total population. In 2016, about 201,000 people became Italian citizens, compared to 130,000 in 2014. Currently, about one million Romanian citizens are officially registered as living in Italy. The number of unregistered Romanians is difficult to estimate, but the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network suggested in 2007 that there might have been half a million or more. The distribution of immigrants is largely uneven in Italy: 87% live in the northern and central parts of the country. Italy's official language is Italian. There are an estimated 64 million native Italian speakers and another 21 million who use it as a second language. Italian is often natively spoken in a regional variety, not to be confused with Italy's regional and minority languages. 12 \"historical minority languages\" (minoranze linguistiche storiche) are formally recognised. Four of these enjoy a co-official status in their respective region. A number of other Ethnologue, ISO and UNESCO languages are not recognised. In 2017, the proportion of Italians who identified themselves as Roman Catholic Christians was 74.4%. Since 1985, Roman Catholicism is no longer officially the state religion. The Holy See, the episcopal jurisdiction of Rome, contains the central government of the Roman Catholic Church. In 2011, minority Christian faiths in Italy included an estimated 1.5 million Orthodox Christians. Jews have been present in Ancient Rome since before the birth of Christ. Italy has for centuries welcomed Jews expelled from other countries, notably Spain. Italian state devolves shares of income tax to recognised religious communities. Donations are allowed to Christian, Jewish, Buddhist and Hindu communities. Islam remains excluded, since no Muslim communities have yet signed a concordat with the Italian state. Education in Italy is free and mandatory from ages six to 16. It consists of five stages: kindergarten, primary school, lower secondary school, upper secondary school and university. In 2012, the Italian secondary education was evaluated as slightly below the OECD average. The Italian state runs a universal public healthcare system since 1978. Healthcare spending in Italy accounted for 9.2% of the national GDP in 2012. Italy in 2000 ranked as having the world's 2nd best healthcare system. Life expectancy in Italy is 80 for males and 85 for females, placing the country 5th in the world for life expectancy. Italy has a relatively low rate of adult obesity (below 10%), as there are several health benefits of the Mediterranean diet.\n",
      "Italy has had a central role in Western culture for centuries and is still recognised for its cultural traditions and artists. The country has, overall, an estimated 100,000 monuments of any sort. According to some estimates the nation is home to half the world's great art treasures. Italy is known for its considerable architectural achievements, such as the construction of arches, domes and similar structures during ancient Rome. Palladianism inspired movements such as that of Neoclassical architecture, and influenced the designs which noblemen built their country houses all over the world. The Christian concept of a Basilica, a style of church architecture that came to dominate the early Middle Ages, was invented in Rome. The early Christians' art and architecture was also widely inspired by that of the pagan Romans. The first significant buildings in the medieval Romanesque style were churches built in Italy during the 800's. The greatest flowering of Italian architecture took place during the Renaissance. Filippo Brunelleschi made great contributions to architectural design with his dome for the Cathedral of Florence. The most original work of all late Baroque and Rococo architecture is the Palazzina di caccia di Stupinigi, dating back to the 18th century. The history of Italian visual arts is significant to the history of Western painting. Roman art was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting. The only surviving Roman paintings are wall paintings, many from villas in Campania. The Italian Renaissance is said by many to be the golden age of painting; roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th centuries. In Italy artists like Paolo Uccello, Fra Angelico, Masaccio, Piero della Francesca, Andrea Mantegna, Filippo Lippi, Giorgione, Tintoretto, Sandro Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo Buonarroti, Raphael, Giovanni Bellini, and Titian. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the High Renaissance gave rise to a stylised art known as Mannerism. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterised art, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. Among the greatest painters of Italian Baroque are Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, Artemisia Gentileschi, Mattia Preti, Carlo Saraceni and Bartolomeo Manfredi. Italian Rococo was mainly inspired by French Rococo, since France was the founding nation of that particular style. In the 19th century, major Italian Romantic painters were Francesco Hayez, Giuseppe Bezzuoli and Francesco Podesti. Impressionism was brought from France to Italy by the Macchiaioli, led by Giovanni Fattori, and Giovanni Boldini. Realism was followed by Futurism, primarily through the works of Umberto Boccioni and Giacomo Balla. Surrealism was succeeded by the metaphysical paintings of Giorgio de Chirico. Formal Latin literature began in 240 BC, when the first stage play was performed in Rome. The Romans were also famous for their oral tradition, poetry, drama and epigrams. In early years of 13th century, St. Francis of Assisi was considered the first Italian poet by literary critics. At the court of Emperor Frederick II, lyrics modelled on Provençal forms and themes were written in a refined version of the local vernacular. Guido Guinizelli is considered the founder of the Dolce Stil Novo, a school that added a philosophical dimension to traditional love poetry. Niccolò Machiavelli's The Prince is one of the world's most famous essays. Ludovico Ariosto's Orlando Furioso is perhaps the greatest chivalry poem ever written. Torquato Tasso in Jerusalem Delivered wrote a Christian epic. In the early 17th century, some literary masterpieces were created, such as Giambattista Marino's long mythological poem, L'Adone. The Baroque period also produced the clear scientific prose of Galileo as well as Tommaso Campanella's The City of the Sun. Italian writers embraced Romanticism in the early 19th century. The Romanticism coincided with some ideas of the Risorgimento. The time of Italy's rebirth was heralded by poets Vittorio Alfieri, Ugo Foscolo, and Giacomo Leopardi. Italian philosophy and literature had a vast influence on Western philosophy. Philosophy was brought to Italy by Pythagoras, founder of the Italian school of philosophy in Crotone. Major Italian philosophers of the Greek period include Xenophanes, Parmenides, Zeno, Empedocles and Gorgias. Italian Medieval philosophy was mainly Christian, and included several important philosophers and theologians such as St Thomas Aquinas. Notable Renaissance philosophers include: Giordano Bruno, Marsilio Ficino, Niccolò Machiavelli, and Cesare Beccaria. Italy also had a renowned philosophical movement in the 1800s, with Idealism, Sensism and Empiricism. The theatre of ancient Rome was a thriving and diverse art form. The Hellenization of Roman culture in the 3rd century BCE had a profound and energising effect on Roman theatre. Commedia dell'arte was a form of improvisational theatre, and it is still performed today. The Teatro di San Carlo in Naples is the oldest continuously active venue for public opera in the world. It opened in 1737, decades before both the Milan's La Scala and Venice's La Fenice theatres. Italian music has always played an important role in Italian culture. Instruments associated with classical music, including the piano and violin, were invented in Italy. Many of the prevailing classical music forms can trace their roots back to innovations of 16th- and 17th-century Italian music. Italy's most famous composers include the Renaissance composers Palestrina, Monteverdi and Gesualdo. Modern Italian composers such as Berio and Nono proved significant in the development of experimental and electronic music. Italian opera was believed to have been founded in the early 17th century. Works by native Italian composers of the 19th and early 20th centuries are among the most famous operas ever written. Italy was at the forefront of the progressive rock and pop movement of the 1970s. In the early 1980s, the first star to emerge from the Italian hip hop scene was singer Jovanotti. Italian metal bands such as Rhapsody of Fire, Lacuna Coil, Elvenking, Forgotten Tomb, and Fleshgod Apocalypse are also seen as pioneers of various heavy metal subgenres. Italy was also an important country in the development of disco and electronic music. Italo disco, known for its futuristic sound and prominent use of synthesisers and drum machines, was one of the earliest electronic dance genres. By the latter half of the 1990s, a subgenre of Eurodance known as Italo dance emerged. Italian pop music is represented annually with the Sanremo Music Festival, which served as inspiration for the Eurovision song contest. Singers such as Mina, Andrea Bocelli, Grammy winner Laura Pausini, Zucchero and Eros Ramazzotti have attained international acclaim. The first Italian film was a few seconds, showing Pope Leo XIII giving a blessing to the camera. The Italian film industry was born between 1903 and 1908 with three companies: the Società Italiana Cines, the Ambrosio Film and the Itala Film. Cinema was later used by Benito Mussolini for the production of Fascist propaganda until World War II. As the country grew wealthier in the 1950s, a form of neorealism succeeded, and other film genres, such as sword-and-sandal followed as spaghetti westerns. Actresses such as Sophia Loren, Giulietta Masina and Gina Lollobrigida achieved international stardom during this period. Italy is the most awarded country at the Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, with 14 awards won. As of 2016, Italian films have also won 12 Palmes d'Or (the second-most of any country), 11 Golden Lions and 7 Golden Bears. Italy's national football team is one of the world's most successful teams. Italian clubs have won 48 major European trophies, making Italy the second most successful country in European football. Italy's top-flight club football league is named Serie A. The Italian national basketball team's best results were gold at Eurobasket 1983 and EuroBasket 1999. Lega Basket Serie A is widely considered one of the most competitive in Europe. The men's volleyball team won three consecutive World Championships and earned the Olympic silver medal in 1996, 2004, and 2016. Tennis is the fourth most practised sport in Italy. Italian professional tennis players won the Davis Cup in 1976 and the Fed Cup in 2006, 2009, 2010 and 2013. Italian Scuderia Ferrari is the oldest surviving team in Grand Prix racing, having competed since 1948. Italian sportsmen have won 522 medals at the Summer Olympic Games, and another 106 at the Winter Olympic Games. The country hosted two Winter Olympics and will host a third (in 1956, 2006, and 2026), and one Summer games (in 1960) Milan, Florence and Rome are Italy's main fashion capitals. Italy is also prominent in the field of design, notably interior design, architectural design, industrial design and urban design. Italian phrases such as \"Bel Disegno\" and \"Linea Italiana\" have entered the vocabulary of furniture design. The Mediterranean diet forms the basis of Italian cuisine, rich in pasta, fish, fruits and vegetables. Dishes and recipes are often derivatives from local and familial tradition rather than created by chefs. Ingredients and dishes vary widely by region. Italy has the most traditional specialities protected under EU law. Cheese, cold cuts and wine are a major part of Italian cuisine. Gelato, tiramisù and cassata are among the most famous examples. Italy's National Day, the Festa della Repubblica (Republic Day) is celebrated on 2 June each year. It commemorates the birth of the Italian Republic in 1946. Public holidays in Italy include religious, national and regional observances. The Epiphany in Italy is associated with the folkloristic figure of the Befana. The Assumption of Mary coincides with Ferragosto on 15 August. Each city or town also celebrates a public holiday on the occasion of the local patron saint.\n",
      "[\"According to Strabo's Geographica, before the expansion of the Roman Republic, the name was used by Greeks to indicate the land between the strait of Messina and the line connecting the gulf of Salerno and gulf of Taranto. In 264 BC, Roman Italy extended from the Arno and Rubicon rivers of the centre-north to the entire south. The northern area of Cisalpine Gaul was occupied by Rome in the 220s BC and became considered geographically and de facto part of Italy.\", 'Thousands of Paleolithic-era artifacts have been recovered from Monte Poggiolo and dated to around 850,000 years before the present. They are the oldest evidence of first hominins habitation in the peninsula. The ancient peoples of pre-Roman Italy were Indo-European peoples. The main historic peoples of possible non-Indo-European heritage include the Etruscans of central and northern Italy. The prehistoric Sardinians gave birth to the Nuragic civilisation. Rome was ruled for a period of 244 years by a monarchical system. Initially with sovereigns of Latin and Sabine origin, later by Etruscan kings. In 509 BC, the Romans expelled the last king from their city, favouring a government of the Senate and the People. The Roman Empire was among the most powerful economic, cultural, political and military forces in the world of its time. At its height under Trajan, it covered 5 million square kilometres. The Roman legacy has deeply influenced the Western civilisation. The Western Empire, under the pressure of the barbarian invasions, eventually dissolved in 476 AD when its last emperor, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed. The Eastern half of the Empire survived for another thousand years. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Italy fell under the power of Odoacer\\'s kingdom. The Lombard kingdom was subsequently absorbed into the Frankish Empire by Charlemagne in the late 8th century. The Franks also helped the formation of the Papal States in central Italy. In 1176 a league of city-states, the Lombard League, defeated the German emperor Frederick Barbarossa at the Battle of Legnano. Given the power vacuum caused by extreme territorial fragmentation and the struggle between the Empire and the Holy See, local communities sought autonomous ways to maintain law and order. The four best known maritime republics were Venice, Genoa, Pisa and Amalfi. The others were Ancona, Gaeta, Noli, and Ragusa. Venice maintained enormous tracts of land in Greece, Cyprus, Istria and Dalmatia. Venice and Genoa were Europe\\'s main gateway to trade with the East, and a producer of fine glass. Florence was a capital of silk, wool, banks and jewellery. The wealth such business brought to Italy meant that large public and private artistic projects could be commissioned. Italy was the birthplace and heart of the Renaissance during the 1400s and 1500s. Renaissance exercised a dominant influence on subsequent European painting and sculpture for centuries afterwards. Artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Brunelleschi, Botticelli, Michelangelo, Raphael, Giotto, Donatello, and Titian. Following the western schism in favor of Rome at the Council of Constance (1415–1417), the new Pope Martin V returned to the Papal States. The Medici Bank was made the official credit institution of the Papacy. The Popes\\' status as elective monarchs turned the conclaves and consistories of the Renaissance into political battles between the courts of Italy for primacy in the peninsula. The fall of Constantinople led to the migration of Greek scholars and texts to Italy. Humanist rulers such as Federico da Montefeltro and Pope Pius II worked to establish ideal cities. Pico della Mirandola wrote the Oration on the Dignity of Man, considered the manifesto of Renaissance Humanism. Italian explorers and navigators from the dominant maritime republics offered their services to monarchs of Atlantic countries. Christopher Columbus is credited with discovering the New World and the opening of the Americas for conquest and settlement by Europeans. Key events of the period include: the Council of Trent (1545–1563), the excommunication of Elizabeth I (1570) and the Battle of Lepanto (1571) The Papacy remained independent and launched the Counter-reformation. The Italian economy declined during the 1600s and 1700s, as the peninsula was excluded from the rising Atlantic slave trade. During the Coalition Wars, northern-central Italy was reorganised by Napoleon in a number of Sister Republics of France and later as a Kingdom of Italy in personal union with the French Empire. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the political and social Italian unification movement, or Risorgimento, emerged. A prominent radical figure was the patriotic journalist Giuseppe Mazzini, member of the secret revolutionary society Carbonari. The most famous member of Young Italy was the revolutionary and general Giuseppe Garibaldi, renowned for his loyal followers. The Northern Italy monarchy of the House of Savoy in the Kingdom of Sardinia also had ambitions of establishing a united Italian state. Garibaldi led the drive for unification in Naples and Sicily. House of Savoy troops occupied the central territories of the Italian peninsula, except Rome and part of Papal States. Garibaldi sacrificed republican hopes for the sake of Italian unity under a monarchy. Victor Emmanuel II became the first king of a united Italy. In 1866, Victor Emmanuel II allied with Prussia during the Austro-Prussian War. In 1870, as France abandoned its garrisons in Rome, the Italians rushed to fill the power gap. Italian unification was completed and shortly afterward Italy\\'s capital was moved to Rome. The new Kingdom of Italy obtained Great Power status. As Northern Italy quickly industrialised, the South and rural areas of the North remained underdeveloped. The Italian Socialist Party constantly increased in strength, challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment. Italy developed into a colonial power by forcing under its rule Eritrea and Somalia in East Africa, Tripolitania and Cyrenaica in North Africa. From 2 November 1899 to 7 September 1901, Italy also participated as part of the Eight-Nation Alliance forces during the Boxer Rebellion in China. The pre-war period dominated by Giovanni Giolitti, Prime Minister five times between 1892 and 1921, was characterized by the economic, industrial and political-cultural modernization of Italian society. Italy joined the Allies into World War I with a promise of substantial territorial gains. The war was initially inconclusive, as the Italian army got stuck in a long attrition war in the Alps. Eventually, in October 1918, the Italians launched a massive offensive, culminating in the victory of Vittorio Veneto. During the war, more than 650,000 Italian soldiers and as many civilians died and the kingdom went to the brink of bankruptcy. Italy gained a permanent seat in the League of Nations\\'s executive council and obtained most of the promised territories. The socialist agitations that followed the devastation of the Great War led to counter-revolution and repression throughout Italy. The liberal establishment, fearing a Soviet-style revolution, started to endorse the small National Fascist Party, led by Benito Mussolini. In October 1922 the Blackshirts attempted a coup  named the \"March on Rome\" which failed. In 1935, Mussolini invaded Ethiopia and founded the Italian East Africa. In 1939, Italy annexed Albania, a de facto protectorate for decades. Italy entered World War II on 10 June 1940. The Italians were defeated in East Africa, Soviet Union and North Africa. During the interwar period, the fascist Italian government undertook a campaign of Italianisation in the areas it annexed. During World War II, Italian war crimes included extrajudicial killings and ethnic cleansing by deportation of about 25,000 people. In Italy and Yugoslavia, unlike in Germany, few war crimes were prosecuted. Yugoslav Partisans perpetrated their own crimes during and after the war, including the foibe killings. About 250,000 Italians and anti-communist Slavs fled to Italy in the Istrian exodus. An Allied invasion of Sicily began in July 1943, leading to the collapse of the Fascist regime and the fall of Mussolini on 25 July. Mussolini was deposed and arrested by order of King Victor Emmanuel III in co-operation with the majority of the members of the Grand Council of Fascism. Italy signed the Armistice of Cassibile, ending its war with the Allies. In the north, the Germans set up the Italian Social Republic (RSI), a Nazi puppet state with Mussolini installed as leader. Some Italian troops in the south were organized into the Italian Co-belligerent Army, which fought alongside the Allies for the rest of the war. Other Italian troops, loyal to Mussolini and his RSI, continued to fight alongside the Germans in the National Republican Army. In late April 1945, with total defeat looming, Mussolini attempted to escape north, but was captured and summarily executed near Lake Como. His body was then taken to Milan, where it was hung upside down at a service station for public viewing and to provide confirmation of his demise. Italy became a republic after a referendum held on 2 June 1946. This was also the first time that Italian women were entitled to vote. Victor Emmanuel III\\'s son, Umberto II, was forced to abdicate and exiled. Fears of a possible Communist takeover (especially in the United States) proved crucial for the first universal suffrage electoral outcome on 18 April 1948. In 1949 Italy became a member of NATO. In 1957, Italy was a founding member of the European Economic Community (EEC) From the late 1960s until the early 1980s, Italy experienced a period of economic crisis and social conflicts. The Years of Lead culminated in the assassination of Christian Democrat leader Aldo Moro in 1978 and the Bologna railway station massacre in 1980. In the 1980s, for the first time since 1945, two governments were led by non-Christian-Democrat premiers. During Bettino Craxi\\'s government, the economy recovered and Italy became the world\\'s fifth largest industrial nation. However, as a result of his spending policies, the Italian national debt skyrocketed during the Craxi era, soon passing 100% of the country\\'s GDP. In 1992, two major dynamite attacks killed the judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino. One year later, tourist spots were attacked, such as the Via dei Georgofili in Florence, Via Palestro in Milan and the Piazza San Giovanni in Laterano. The Catholic Church openly condemned the Mafia, and two churches were bombed and an anti-Mafia priest shot dead in Rome. Berlusconi resigned in 2011, and his conservative government was replaced by the technocratic cabinet of Mario Monti. Following the 2013 general election, the Vice-Secretary of the Democratic Party Enrico Letta formed a new government at the head of a right-left Grand coalition. In 2014, challenged by the new Secretary of the PD Matteo Renzi, Letta resigned. The new government started important constitutional reforms such as the abolition of the Senate and a new electoral law. In the European migrant crisis of the 2010s, Italy was the entry point and leading destination for most asylum seekers entering the EU. From 2013 to 2018, the country took in over 700,000 migrants and refugees, mainly from sub-Saharan Africa. The 2018 general election was characterized by a strong showing of the Five Star Movement and the League.', \"Italy is located in Southern Europe, between latitudes 35° and 47° N, and longitudes 6° and 19° E. To the north, Italy borders France, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia. The sovereign states of San Marino and the Vatican City are enclaves within Italy. Campione d'Italia is an Italian exclave in Switzerland. Italy's total area is 301,230 square kilometres (116,306 sq mi), of which 294,020 km2 (113,522 sq mi) is land. The Apennine Mountains form the peninsula's backbone, and the Alps form most of its northern boundary. The Po Valley is the largest plain in Italy, with 46,000 km2 (18,000 sq mi) It represents over 70% of the total plain area in the country. Most of the small islands and archipelagos in the south are volcanic islands. There are also active volcanoes: Mount Etna in Sicily (the largest active volcano in Europe), Vulcano, Stromboli, and Vesuvius. There are also volcanoes on mainland Europe. The five largest lakes in Italy are Garda, Maggiore, Como, Trasimeno and Bolsena. Garda is the largest lake in Italy, with a surface of367.94 km2 (142 sq mi) Some of Italy's territory extends beyond the Alpine basin and some islands are located outside the Eurasian continental shelf. These territories are the comuni of Livigno, Sexten, Innichen, Toblach (in part), Chiusaforte, Tarvisio, Graun im Vinschgau. Most of the rivers of Italy drain either into the Adriatic Sea, such as the Po, Piave, Adige, Brenta, Tagliamento, and Reno, or into the Tyrrhenian. In the north of the country are a number of subalpine moraine-dammed lakes, the largest of which is Garda. There are 14 volcanoes in Italy, four of which are active. Etna, Stromboli, Vulcano and Vesuvius are most famous for their eruptions. Several islands and hills have been created by volcanic activity. Italy was the first country to exploit geothermal energy to produce electricity. The high geothermal gradient that forms part of the peninsula makes potentially exploitable also other provinces. Research carried out in the 1960s and 1970s identifies potential geothermal fields in Lazio and Tuscany. Italy ranks 84th in the world for ecological sustainability. In the last decade, Italy has become one of the world's leading producers of renewable energy. Renewable energies now make up about 12% of the total primary and final energy consumption. Air pollution remains a severe problem, especially in the industrialised north. Italy reached the tenth highest level worldwide of industrial carbon dioxide emissions in the 1990s. Italy is the twelfth largest carbon dioxide producer. <s>Smog is becoming an increasingly rarer phenomenon and levels of sulphur dioxide are decreasing. Smog levels have decreased dramatically since the 1970s and 1980s. Traffic and congestion continue to cause severe environmental and health issues. Many watercourses and coastal stretches have also been contaminated by industrial and agricultural activity. Waste from industrial activity is not always disposed of by legal means and has led to permanent health effects. The country has also operated several nuclear reactors between 1963 and 1990. Italy has the highest level of faunal biodiversity in Europe, with over 57,000 species recorded. The Italian peninsula is in the centre of the Mediterranean Sea, forming a corridor between central Europe and North Africa. Italy's varied geological structure contributes to its high climate and habitat diversity. Italian fauna includes 4,777 endemic animal species. There are 516 bird species and 56,213 invertebrate species. Italian wolf, Marsican brown bear, Pyrenean chamois, Alpine ibex, crested porcupine, Mediterranean monk seal, Alpine marmot. As of 2005, 6,759 species are recorded in the Data bank of Italian vascular flora. Italy is a signatory to the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats and the Habitats Directive. The climate of Italy is highly diverse. In most of the inland northern and central regions, the climate ranges from humid subtropical to humid continental and oceanic. The climate of the Po valley geographical region is mostly continental, with harsh winters and hot summers. Average summer temperatures in Sicily range from 20 °C to over 25 °C. Winters can vary widely across the country with lingering cold, foggy and snowy periods in the north and milder, sunnier conditions in the south.\", \"The President of Italy (Presidente della Repubblica), currently Sergio Mattarella since 2015, is Italy's head of state. The President is elected for a single seven years mandate by the Parliament of Italy and some regional voters in joint session. Italy has been a unitary parliamentary republic since 2 June 1946. Italy has a parliamentary government based on a mixed proportional and majoritarian voting system. The parliament is perfectly bicameral: the two houses, the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic, have the same powers. The Prime Minister, officially President of the Council of Ministers, is Italy's head of government. The prime minister is the President of the Council of Ministers. The office is similar to those in most other parliamentary systems. The leader of the Italian government is not authorised to request the dissolution of the Parliament of Italy. The overall political responsibility for intelligence is vested in the President of the Council of Ministers. By virtue of that, the Prime Minister has exclusive power to: co-ordinate intelligence policies, determining the financial resources and strengthening national cyber security. During the 2018 general election these three parties won 614 out of 630 seats available in the Chamber of Deputies and 309 out of 315 in the Senate. Berlusconi's Forza Italia formed a centre-right coalition with Matteo Salvini's Northern League and Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy. The Italian judicial system is based on Roman law modified by the Napoleonic code and later statutes. The Supreme Court of Cassation is the highest court in Italy for both criminal and civil appeal cases. The Constitutional Court of Italy (Corte Costituzionale) rules on the conformity of laws with the constitution. The Italian law enforcement system is complex, with multiple police forces. The national policing agencies are the Polizia di Stato (State Police), the Arma dei Carabinieri, the Guardia di Finanza (Financial Guard), and the Polizeia Penitenziaria (Prison Police) Italy is a founding member of the European Economic Community (EEC), now the European Union (EU), and of NATO. Italy was admitted to the United Nations in 1955. Its recent or upcoming turns in the rotating presidency of international organisations include the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in 2018. As of 2013, Italy was deploying 5,296 troops abroad, engaged in 33 UN and NATO missions in 25 countries of the world. Italy deployed troops in support of UN peacekeeping missions in Somalia, Mozambique, and East Timor. Italy supported international efforts to reconstruct and stabilise Iraq, but it had withdrawn its military contingent of some 3,200 troops by 2006. Italy maintained only humanitarian operators and other civilian personnel in Iraq. In August 2006 Italy deployed about 2,450 troops in Lebanon for the United Nations' peacekeeping mission UNIFIL. Italy is one of the largest financiers of the Palestinian National Authority, contributing €60 million in 2013 alone. The Italian Army, Navy, Air Force and Carabinieri collectively form the Italian Armed Forces. Total Italian military spending in 2010 ranked tenth in the world, standing at $35.8 billion, equal to 1.7% of national GDP. Since 2005, military service is voluntary. The Italian Navy in 2008 had 35,200 active personnel with 85 commissioned ships and 123 aircraft. In modern times the Italian Navy, being a member of the EU and NATO, has taken part in many coalition peacekeeping operations. The Italian Air Force in 2008 had a strength of 43,882 and operated 585 aircraft, including 219 combat jets and 114 helicopters. A transport capability is guaranteed by a fleet of 27 C-130Js and C-27J Spartan. The Carabinieri are the gendarmerie and military police of Italy. They are an autonomous corps of the military, but report to the Ministry of Internal Affairs when maintaining public order and security. Italy is constituted by 20 regions (regioni), 107 provinces (province) or metropolitan cities (città metropolitane), and 7,960 municipalities (comuni) Five regions have a special autonomous status that enables them to enact legislation on additional matters.\", \"Italy is a founding member of the G7, the Eurozone and the OECD. It is a highly developed country, with the world's 8th highest quality of life. The country is well known for its creative and innovative business. Italy is the world's sixth largest manufacturing country. It is characterised by a smaller number of global multinational corporations than other economies of comparable size. Its closest trade ties are with the other countries of the European Union, with whom it conducts 59% of its total trade. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles or FCA is currently the world's seventh-largest auto maker. The country boasts a wide range of acclaimed products, from very compact city cars to luxury supercars such as Maserati, Lamborghini and Ferrari. Italy has been hit hard by the Financial crisis of 2007–08, that exacerbated the country's structural problems. A gaping North–South divide is a major factor of socio-economic weakness. The richest province, Alto Adige-South Tyrol, earns 152% of the national GDP per capita. According to the last national agricultural census, there were 1.6 million farms in 2010. The vast majority (99%) are family-operated and small, averaging only 8 hectares in size. The most famous Italian wines are probably the Tuscan Chianti and the Piedmontese Barolo. Quality goods in which Italy specialises are often protected under the quality assurance labels DOC/DOP. This geographical indication certificate is considered important in order to avoid confusion with low-quality mass-produced ersatz products. In 2002 there were 668,721 km (415,524 mi) of serviceable roads in Italy. In 2005, about 34,667,000 passenger cars and 4,015,000 goods vehicles circulated on the national road network. The national railway network, state-owned and operated by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana, in 2008 totalled 16,529 km (10,271 mi) Italy is one of the countries with the most vehicles per capita, with 690 per 1000 people in 2010. The national inland waterways network comprised 2,400 km (1,491 mi) of navigable rivers and channels for various types of commercial traffic in 2012. Italy is the fifth in Europe by number of passengers by air transport, with about 148 million passengers or about 10% of the European total in 2011. In 2012 there were 130 airports in Italy, including the two hubs of Malpensa International in Milan and Leonardo da Vinci International in Rome. Moderate natural gas reserves, mainly in the Po Valley and offshore Adriatic Sea, have been discovered in recent years. Italy is one of the world's leading producers of pumice, pozzolana, and feldspar. Italy has become one of the world's largest producers of renewable energy. Wind power, hydroelectricity, and geothermal power are also important sources of electricity in the country. Renewable sources account for the 27.5% of all electricity produced in Italy. During the Renaissance Italian polymaths such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Leon Battista Alberti made important contributions to a variety of fields. Galileo Galilei (1564–1642), a physicist, mathematician and astronomer, played a major role in the Scientific Revolution. Other astronomers suchs as Giovanni Domenico Cassini (1625–1712) and Giovanni Schiaparelli (1835–1910) made many important discoveries about the Solar System. In mathematics, Joseph Louis Lagrange (born Giuseppe Lodovico Lagrangia, 1736–1813) was active before leaving Italy. In chemistry, Giulio Natta received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1963 for his work on high polymers. Italy is the fifth most visited country in the world, with a total of 52.3 million international arrivals in 2016. The total contribution of travel & tourism to GDP (including wider effects from investment, the supply chain and induced income impacts) was EUR162.7bn in 2014.\", 'At the beginning of 2020, Italy had 60,317,116 inhabitants. The resulting population density, at 202 inhabitants per square kilometre (520/sq mi), is higher than that of most Western European countries. The Po Valley accounts for almost a half of the national population. The population of Italy almost doubled during the 20th century. High fertility and birth rates persisted until the 1970s, after which they started to decline. By 2010, one in five Italians was over 65 years old, and the country currently has the fifth oldest population in the world. In 2016, Italy had about 5.05 million foreign residents, making up 8.3% of the total population. In 2016, about 201,000 people became Italian citizens, compared to 130,000 in 2014. Currently, about one million Romanian citizens are officially registered as living in Italy. The number of unregistered Romanians is difficult to estimate, but the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network suggested in 2007 that there might have been half a million or more. The distribution of immigrants is largely uneven in Italy: 87% live in the northern and central parts of the country. Italy\\'s official language is Italian. There are an estimated 64 million native Italian speakers and another 21 million who use it as a second language. Italian is often natively spoken in a regional variety, not to be confused with Italy\\'s regional and minority languages. 12 \"historical minority languages\" (minoranze linguistiche storiche) are formally recognised. Four of these enjoy a co-official status in their respective region. A number of other Ethnologue, ISO and UNESCO languages are not recognised. In 2017, the proportion of Italians who identified themselves as Roman Catholic Christians was 74.4%. Since 1985, Roman Catholicism is no longer officially the state religion. The Holy See, the episcopal jurisdiction of Rome, contains the central government of the Roman Catholic Church. In 2011, minority Christian faiths in Italy included an estimated 1.5 million Orthodox Christians. Jews have been present in Ancient Rome since before the birth of Christ. Italy has for centuries welcomed Jews expelled from other countries, notably Spain. Italian state devolves shares of income tax to recognised religious communities. Donations are allowed to Christian, Jewish, Buddhist and Hindu communities. Islam remains excluded, since no Muslim communities have yet signed a concordat with the Italian state. Education in Italy is free and mandatory from ages six to 16. It consists of five stages: kindergarten, primary school, lower secondary school, upper secondary school and university. In 2012, the Italian secondary education was evaluated as slightly below the OECD average. The Italian state runs a universal public healthcare system since 1978. Healthcare spending in Italy accounted for 9.2% of the national GDP in 2012. Italy in 2000 ranked as having the world\\'s 2nd best healthcare system. Life expectancy in Italy is 80 for males and 85 for females, placing the country 5th in the world for life expectancy. Italy has a relatively low rate of adult obesity (below 10%), as there are several health benefits of the Mediterranean diet.', 'Italy has had a central role in Western culture for centuries and is still recognised for its cultural traditions and artists. The country has, overall, an estimated 100,000 monuments of any sort. According to some estimates the nation is home to half the world\\'s great art treasures. Italy is known for its considerable architectural achievements, such as the construction of arches, domes and similar structures during ancient Rome. Palladianism inspired movements such as that of Neoclassical architecture, and influenced the designs which noblemen built their country houses all over the world. The Christian concept of a Basilica, a style of church architecture that came to dominate the early Middle Ages, was invented in Rome. The early Christians\\' art and architecture was also widely inspired by that of the pagan Romans. The first significant buildings in the medieval Romanesque style were churches built in Italy during the 800\\'s. The greatest flowering of Italian architecture took place during the Renaissance. Filippo Brunelleschi made great contributions to architectural design with his dome for the Cathedral of Florence. The most original work of all late Baroque and Rococo architecture is the Palazzina di caccia di Stupinigi, dating back to the 18th century. The history of Italian visual arts is significant to the history of Western painting. Roman art was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting. The only surviving Roman paintings are wall paintings, many from villas in Campania. The Italian Renaissance is said by many to be the golden age of painting; roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th centuries. In Italy artists like Paolo Uccello, Fra Angelico, Masaccio, Piero della Francesca, Andrea Mantegna, Filippo Lippi, Giorgione, Tintoretto, Sandro Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo Buonarroti, Raphael, Giovanni Bellini, and Titian. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the High Renaissance gave rise to a stylised art known as Mannerism. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterised art, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. Among the greatest painters of Italian Baroque are Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, Artemisia Gentileschi, Mattia Preti, Carlo Saraceni and Bartolomeo Manfredi. Italian Rococo was mainly inspired by French Rococo, since France was the founding nation of that particular style. In the 19th century, major Italian Romantic painters were Francesco Hayez, Giuseppe Bezzuoli and Francesco Podesti. Impressionism was brought from France to Italy by the Macchiaioli, led by Giovanni Fattori, and Giovanni Boldini. Realism was followed by Futurism, primarily through the works of Umberto Boccioni and Giacomo Balla. Surrealism was succeeded by the metaphysical paintings of Giorgio de Chirico. Formal Latin literature began in 240 BC, when the first stage play was performed in Rome. The Romans were also famous for their oral tradition, poetry, drama and epigrams. In early years of 13th century, St. Francis of Assisi was considered the first Italian poet by literary critics. At the court of Emperor Frederick II, lyrics modelled on Provençal forms and themes were written in a refined version of the local vernacular. Guido Guinizelli is considered the founder of the Dolce Stil Novo, a school that added a philosophical dimension to traditional love poetry. Niccolò Machiavelli\\'s The Prince is one of the world\\'s most famous essays. Ludovico Ariosto\\'s Orlando Furioso is perhaps the greatest chivalry poem ever written. Torquato Tasso in Jerusalem Delivered wrote a Christian epic. In the early 17th century, some literary masterpieces were created, such as Giambattista Marino\\'s long mythological poem, L\\'Adone. The Baroque period also produced the clear scientific prose of Galileo as well as Tommaso Campanella\\'s The City of the Sun. Italian writers embraced Romanticism in the early 19th century. The Romanticism coincided with some ideas of the Risorgimento. The time of Italy\\'s rebirth was heralded by poets Vittorio Alfieri, Ugo Foscolo, and Giacomo Leopardi. Italian philosophy and literature had a vast influence on Western philosophy. Philosophy was brought to Italy by Pythagoras, founder of the Italian school of philosophy in Crotone. Major Italian philosophers of the Greek period include Xenophanes, Parmenides, Zeno, Empedocles and Gorgias. Italian Medieval philosophy was mainly Christian, and included several important philosophers and theologians such as St Thomas Aquinas. Notable Renaissance philosophers include: Giordano Bruno, Marsilio Ficino, Niccolò Machiavelli, and Cesare Beccaria. Italy also had a renowned philosophical movement in the 1800s, with Idealism, Sensism and Empiricism. The theatre of ancient Rome was a thriving and diverse art form. The Hellenization of Roman culture in the 3rd century BCE had a profound and energising effect on Roman theatre. Commedia dell\\'arte was a form of improvisational theatre, and it is still performed today. The Teatro di San Carlo in Naples is the oldest continuously active venue for public opera in the world. It opened in 1737, decades before both the Milan\\'s La Scala and Venice\\'s La Fenice theatres. Italian music has always played an important role in Italian culture. Instruments associated with classical music, including the piano and violin, were invented in Italy. Many of the prevailing classical music forms can trace their roots back to innovations of 16th- and 17th-century Italian music. Italy\\'s most famous composers include the Renaissance composers Palestrina, Monteverdi and Gesualdo. Modern Italian composers such as Berio and Nono proved significant in the development of experimental and electronic music. Italian opera was believed to have been founded in the early 17th century. Works by native Italian composers of the 19th and early 20th centuries are among the most famous operas ever written. Italy was at the forefront of the progressive rock and pop movement of the 1970s. In the early 1980s, the first star to emerge from the Italian hip hop scene was singer Jovanotti. Italian metal bands such as Rhapsody of Fire, Lacuna Coil, Elvenking, Forgotten Tomb, and Fleshgod Apocalypse are also seen as pioneers of various heavy metal subgenres. Italy was also an important country in the development of disco and electronic music. Italo disco, known for its futuristic sound and prominent use of synthesisers and drum machines, was one of the earliest electronic dance genres. By the latter half of the 1990s, a subgenre of Eurodance known as Italo dance emerged. Italian pop music is represented annually with the Sanremo Music Festival, which served as inspiration for the Eurovision song contest. Singers such as Mina, Andrea Bocelli, Grammy winner Laura Pausini, Zucchero and Eros Ramazzotti have attained international acclaim. The first Italian film was a few seconds, showing Pope Leo XIII giving a blessing to the camera. The Italian film industry was born between 1903 and 1908 with three companies: the Società Italiana Cines, the Ambrosio Film and the Itala Film. Cinema was later used by Benito Mussolini for the production of Fascist propaganda until World War II. As the country grew wealthier in the 1950s, a form of neorealism succeeded, and other film genres, such as sword-and-sandal followed as spaghetti westerns. Actresses such as Sophia Loren, Giulietta Masina and Gina Lollobrigida achieved international stardom during this period. Italy is the most awarded country at the Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, with 14 awards won. As of 2016, Italian films have also won 12 Palmes d\\'Or (the second-most of any country), 11 Golden Lions and 7 Golden Bears. Italy\\'s national football team is one of the world\\'s most successful teams. Italian clubs have won 48 major European trophies, making Italy the second most successful country in European football. Italy\\'s top-flight club football league is named Serie A. The Italian national basketball team\\'s best results were gold at Eurobasket 1983 and EuroBasket 1999. Lega Basket Serie A is widely considered one of the most competitive in Europe. The men\\'s volleyball team won three consecutive World Championships and earned the Olympic silver medal in 1996, 2004, and 2016. Tennis is the fourth most practised sport in Italy. Italian professional tennis players won the Davis Cup in 1976 and the Fed Cup in 2006, 2009, 2010 and 2013. Italian Scuderia Ferrari is the oldest surviving team in Grand Prix racing, having competed since 1948. Italian sportsmen have won 522 medals at the Summer Olympic Games, and another 106 at the Winter Olympic Games. The country hosted two Winter Olympics and will host a third (in 1956, 2006, and 2026), and one Summer games (in 1960) Milan, Florence and Rome are Italy\\'s main fashion capitals. Italy is also prominent in the field of design, notably interior design, architectural design, industrial design and urban design. Italian phrases such as \"Bel Disegno\" and \"Linea Italiana\" have entered the vocabulary of furniture design. The Mediterranean diet forms the basis of Italian cuisine, rich in pasta, fish, fruits and vegetables. Dishes and recipes are often derivatives from local and familial tradition rather than created by chefs. Ingredients and dishes vary widely by region. Italy has the most traditional specialities protected under EU law. Cheese, cold cuts and wine are a major part of Italian cuisine. Gelato, tiramisù and cassata are among the most famous examples. Italy\\'s National Day, the Festa della Repubblica (Republic Day) is celebrated on 2 June each year. It commemorates the birth of the Italian Republic in 1946. Public holidays in Italy include religious, national and regional observances. The Epiphany in Italy is associated with the folkloristic figure of the Befana. The Assumption of Mary coincides with Ferragosto on 15 August. Each city or town also celebrates a public holiday on the occasion of the local patron saint.']\n"
